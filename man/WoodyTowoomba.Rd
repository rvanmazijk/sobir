\description{
Tree abundance in Towoomba Agricultural Development Center, South Africa relative to 
four soil fertilisation treatments and 16 soil nutrient and element concentrations, 
as published by Mills et al. 2017 in PLoS ONE.
}
\details{
Treatment = 12 treatments of a combination of superphosphate (SP0-SP2; 0, 233, 466 kg/ha/yr) and ammonium sulphate (AS0-AS3; 0, 146, 291, 583, 1166 kg/ha/yr) fertilisation applications.
TreeNum = Number of trees present following three decades of fertilisation and three subsequent decades of passive protection.
EC, pH, B, C, Na, Mg, P, S, N, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, N_NO3, N_NH4 = Soil nutrient and element concentration of the pedoderm (0-2 cm) in mg/kg, except for pH (unitless), EC (uS/cm) and C (%).
